## The Big Lie That Was in the Previous Strategy

The old "Gap Mean Reversion" claimed **89.9% win rate on >0.8% gaps**. Real data says:

| Gap Size | Real Fill Rate | Old Claim |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| >0.8%    | **39.4%**     | 89.9%     |
| >0.5%    | **48.0%**     | 81.0%     |
| 0.3-0.5% | **74.3%**     | —         |

**The bigger the gap, the LESS likely it fills.** This is the truth the data reveals. Large gaps happen for a reason (news, earnings, sector moves). Small gaps are noise that gets filled.

## The Real Strategy: Small Gap Snap

### What the Data Shows

The highest-probability trade in the data is not gap reversal on large gaps. It's:

**Trade SMALL gaps (0.3-0.8%) for PARTIAL fill (50% of gap).**

```
Gap 0.3-0.5% → 74.3% fill rate (436 events)
Gap 0.5-0.8% → 64.7% fill rate (482 events)
Any gap → at least 50% fill happens 75.1% of the time
```

### Why This Works

1. **Small gaps are noise.** No catalyst, no news, just random retail order imbalance at open. Smart money fades it.
2. **Large gaps are news.** Earnings, management change, government policy. The gap reflects new information — it's LESS likely to fill.
3. **Partial fill is reliable.** You don't need 100% fill. Taking 50% of the gap is a high-probability target.

## Rules

### Entry

```
1. Wait for 9:20 AM (let first 5-min candle print)
2. Scan all Nifty 50 for gap between 0.3% and 0.8%
3. Direction:
   Gap UP → SHORT at open
   Gap DOWN → LONG at open
4. Enter at first available price after 9:20 AM
```

### Exit

```
STOP LOSS: 0.5% from entry (tight — small gap, small risk)
TARGET: 50% of the gap filled

Example:
  Stock closes at 100, opens at 101.5 (1.5% gap up)
  → SHORT at 101.5
  → Target: Gap fill target = 50% of 1.5 = 0.75%
    Exit at 101.5 - 0.75% = 100.74
  → SL: 101.5 + 0.5% = 102.01

  Stock closes at 100, opens at 99.0 (1.0% gap down)
  → LONG at 99.0
  → Target: 50% of 1.0 = 0.5%
    Exit at 99.0 + 0.5% = 99.50
  → SL: 99.0 - 0.5% = 98.51

TIME EXIT: 3:10 PM
```

### Position Sizing (per ₹1L account)

```
Risk per trade: 0.5% of capital = ₹500
Position size = ₹500 / (entry_price × 0.005) = ~₹1,00,000 worth
```

### When to Skip

```
❌ Gap > 0.8% (too much momentum, low fill probability)
❌ Gap < 0.3% (too small, not worth the risk)
❌ VIX > 22 (fear-driven gaps don't fill)
❌ Event day (budget, RBI, Fed — news gaps persist)
❌ Stock in F&O ban
❌ First candle after open confirms gap holding (don't fight strong momentum)
```

## Gap Direction Asymmetry (Important)

The data reveals a clear bias:

| Direction | Fill Rate |
|-----------|----------|
| Gap UP    | 63.0%    |
| Gap DOWN  | **71.0%** |

**Gap-down days fill 8% more often than gap-up days.**

Reason: Market has a long bias. Gap-downs create bargains that buyers step into. Gap-ups create euphoria that fades slower.

**Adjustment**: When both gap-up and gap-down trades are available, PREFER the gap-down (long) trade.
