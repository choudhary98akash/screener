## 1. The Day-of-Week Effect (Strongest Signal in the Data)

| Day | Avg Return | % Positive | Personality |
|-----|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Monday | **−0.283%** | 45.4% | Weak, bearish |
| Tuesday | **+0.180%** | 53.8% | Mildly bullish |
| **Wednesday** | **+0.798%** | **65.0%** | **Strongly bullish** |
| **Thursday** | **−0.280%** | **37.6%** | **Strongly bearish** |
| Friday | −0.046% | 45.8% | Neutral, weak |

Wednesday is the outlier: stocks go up 65% of the time, averaging +0.80%.
Thursday is the mirror: stocks go down 62.4% of the time.
The swing between Wednesday and Thursday is **1.08%** — the largest predictable pattern in the dataset.

## 2. Gap Size vs Fill Rate (Monotonic Relationship)

| Gap Range | Events | Filled | Fill Rate |
|-----------|--------|--------|-----------|
| 0.0–0.3% | 1,073 | 975 | 90.9% |
| 0.3–0.5% | 436 | 324 | 74.3% |
| 0.5–0.8% | 482 | 312 | 64.7% |
| 0.8–1.2% | 448 | 220 | 49.1% |
| 1.2–2.0% | 365 | 128 | 35.1% |
| 2.0–5.0% | 172 | 44 | 25.6% |
| >5.0% | 12 | 1 | 8.3% |

The relationship is clean and monotonic: **smaller gaps fill more often, larger gaps fill less often.** There is no threshold where this reverses — every step up in gap size reduces fill probability.

---

## 3. Gap Fill Rate by Day of Week

| Day | Gaps | Filled | Fill Rate |
|-----|------|--------|-----------|
| Monday | 637 | 363 | 57.0% |
| **Tuesday** | **539** | **418** | **77.6%** |
| Wednesday | 637 | 390 | 61.2% |
| Thursday | 588 | 412 | 70.1% |
| Friday | 587 | 421 | 71.7% |

Tuesday is the best day for gap fills (77.6%). Monday is the worst (57.0%).

---

## 4. Gap Fill Rate vs Previous Day's Range

| Prev Day Range | Gaps | Filled | Fill Rate |
|---------------|------|--------|-----------|
| 0.0–1.0% | 184 | 147 | 79.9% |
| 1.0–1.5% | 398 | 278 | 69.8% |
| 1.5–2.0% | 688 | 488 | 70.9% |
| 2.0–3.0% | 1,044 | 670 | 64.2% |
| >3.0% | 674 | 421 | 62.5% |

When the previous day was calm (range <1%), gaps fill 79.9% of the time. When the previous day was volatile (range >3%), gaps fill only 62.5%.

---

## 5. Gap Direction + Previous Day Direction

| Pattern | Gaps | Filled | Fill Rate |
|---------|------|--------|-----------|
| Gap continues prev day trend | 1,173 | 745 | 63.5% |
| Gap reverses prev day trend | 999 | 521 | 52.2% |

Gaps that continue the trend fill more often (63.5%) than gaps that reverse the trend (52.2%). This contradicts the assumption that "reversal gaps fill more."

---

## 6. Gap-Up vs Gap-Down

| | Events | Avg OC Return | Avg Fill % | Filled |
|--|--------|--------------|-----------|--------|
| Gap-Up | 1,463 | +0.035% | 79.4% | 63.0% |
| Gap-Down | 1,260 | −0.052% | 80.4% | 64.9% |

Gap-down days fill slightly more often (64.9% vs 63.0%). Both directions see ~80% average fill percentage (including partial fills).

---

## 7. What Correlates with Next Day's Return?

| Factor | Correlation (r) |
|--------|----------------|
| Today's gap size | **−0.103** |
| Today's return | −0.053 |
| Today's volume vs average | −0.039 |
| Today's range | +0.039 |

Gap size has the strongest (negative) correlation with next day's return: larger gaps today predict lower returns tomorrow.

## 11. Overlooked Patterns (Deeper Exploration)

### 11.1 Volume Surge Effect — Strongest Filter We Missed

| Volume Ratio (vs 10d avg) | Events | Filled | Fill Rate |
|--------------------------|--------|--------|-----------|
| 0.0–0.5x | 158 | 109 | 69.0% |
| 0.5–0.8x | 544 | 309 | 56.8% |
| 0.8–1.0x | 373 | 195 | 52.3% |
| 1.0–1.2x | 276 | 142 | 51.4% |
| 1.2–1.5x | 256 | 123 | 48.0% |
| 1.5–2.0x | 158 | 75 | 47.5% |
| 2.0–3.0x | 79 | 37 | 46.8% |
| 3.0x+ | 53 | 25 | 47.2% |

Fill rate drops **monotonically** from 69% (quiet) to 47% (high volume).
Low vol + gap-down: **63.0%** fill. High vol + gap-down: only **43.8%**.

### 11.2 Close Position in Range → Next Day

| Close Position | Events | Avg Next Return | Positive % |
|---------------|--------|----------------|-----------|
| Bottom 20% | 654 | +0.074% | 50.2% |
| 20–40% | 612 | −0.054% | 48.3% |
| 40–60% | 599 | −0.042% | 45.6% |
| 60–80% | 531 | −0.032% | 47.7% |
| **Top 20%** | **543** | **+0.360%** | **52.7%** |

Stocks closing at the top of their range outperform next day. Strength begets strength — no mean reversion edge.

### 11.3 2-Day "Extreme Persistence" (Not Reversal)

| 2-Day Close Position | Events | Avg Next Return | Positive % |
|---------------------|--------|----------------|-----------|
| > +30 (mild strength) | 571 | +0.420% | 55.0% |
| > +50 (strength) | 289 | +0.573% | 58.8% |
| **> +70 (extreme)** | **127** | **+0.971%** | **62.2%** |
| < −30 (mild weak) | 740 | +0.162% | 52.3% |
| < −50 (weak) | 407 | +0.278% | 56.0% |
| < −70 (extreme) | 116 | +0.392% | 57.8% |

Stocks that have been strong for 2 consecutive days continue being strong. The more extreme the 2-day strength, the stronger the next day. This directly contradicts the "overbought = reversal" assumption.

### 11.4 EMA9 Proximity — Gap Fill Rate

| Distance from EMA9 | Events | Fill Rate |
|-------------------|--------|-----------|
| 0–1% | 651 | **64.5%** |
| 1–2% | 506 | 55.5% |
| 2–5% | 649 | 43.6% |

Gaps near the EMA9 fill far more reliably (64.5%) than gaps far from it (43.6%).

### 11.5 RSI Zones — Gap Fill vs Return Divergence

| RSI Zone | Events | Fill Rate | Avg Return |
|---------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| <30 (oversold) | 123 | **69.9%** | **−0.614%** |
| 30–40 | 207 | 55.6% | −0.398% |
| 40–50 | 300 | 57.7% | −0.002% |
| 50–60 | 312 | 53.5% | +0.569% |
| 60–70 | 262 | 53.4% | +0.485% |
| >70 (overbought) | 214 | **64.0%** | **+0.870%** |

RSI < 30: gap fills 69.9% of the time but stock still closes **−0.61%** (gap fills but trend is down).
RSI > 70: gap fills 64% but stock closes **+0.87%** (momentum survives the fill).

### 11.6 Day × Gap Direction — Best Combos

| Day | Direction | Events | Fill Rate | Avg OC Return |
|-----|-----------|--------|-----------|--------------|
| **Tue** | Gap-down | 152 | **69.7%** | **+0.234%** |
| **Wed** | Gap-down | 114 | **74.6%** | **+0.383%** |
| Thu | Gap-up | 150 | 71.3% | −0.144% |
| Mon | Gap-down | 273 | 39.9% | −0.288% |
| Wed | Gap-up | 305 | 35.1% | +0.265% |

Wednesday gap-downs: **74.6%** fill rate with **+0.38%** avg return — the single best cell in the grid.
Monday gap-ups: only 35.1% fill (worst).
Tuesday gap-downs: 69.7% fill, +0.23% return.

### 11.7 Stock-By-Stock Best Conditions

| Condition | Stocks Where It's #1 | Avg WR |
|-----------|---------------------|--------|
| **Tuesday** | **16 stocks** | **86.2%** |
| gap 0.3–0.5% | 15 stocks | 88.7% |
| gap 0.5–0.8% | 5 stocks | 85.3% |
| Thursday | 4 stocks | 91.7% |
| Low volume | 3 stocks | 81.0% |
| Wednesday | 2 stocks | 88.5% |
| Previous day down | 2 stocks | 88.3% |

Tuesday is the highest-signal day: 16/49 stocks have their best WR on Tuesday (avg 86.2%).
Small gaps (0.3–0.5%) are the best blanket condition: 15 stocks, avg 88.7% WR.

### 11.8 Weekend Effect

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Avg weekend gap (Fri close → Mon open) | **−0.741%** |
| Positive weekends | 228/587 (38.8%) |
| Weekends with >0.3% gap | 553/587 (94.2%) |

Nearly all weekends produce a gap, and 61% of those gaps are negative. Monday opens weak.

### 11.9 Open = Daily High/Low (Extreme Intraday Reversals)

| Pattern | Events | Avg OC Return |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| Open = Day's High | 116 | **−1.928%** |
| Open = Day's Low | 108 | **+1.985%** |

When a stock opens at its high (never trades higher), it closes nearly 2% lower on average.
When it opens at its low (never trades lower), it closes nearly 2% higher.
Rare event (~4% of days) but extremely reliable when it happens.

### 11.10 March vs May — The Month Effect

| Month | Events | Fill Rate | Avg Return |
|-------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| March | 325 | 31.1% | −0.777% |
| April | 653 | 52.2% | +0.543% |
| **May** | **546** | **62.8%** | **+0.088%** |
| **June** | **373** | **61.7%** | **+0.127%** |

March was an outlier — only 31.1% gap fill and −0.78% avg return. May/June are much more favorable with 62% fill rates. A strategy's March performance would look terrible, and May would look great — same strategy, different calendar.

## 12. Even Deeper — Autocorrelation, Z-Score, Sequences & Interactions

### 12.1 Return Autocorrelation — Some Stocks Trend, Some Revert

| Stock | Autocorrelation (r) | Personality |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| ADANIPORTS | **−0.313** | Strong mean-reverter |
| INDUSINDBK | −0.292 | Mean-reverter |
| ASIANPAINT | −0.259 | Mean-reverter |
| DIVISLAB | −0.198 | Mean-reverter |
| TCS | −0.175 | Mild mean-reverter |
| ... | | |
| INFY | **+0.194** | **Trending** |
| BHARTIARTL | +0.186 | Trending |
| HDFCLIFE | +0.177 | Trending |
| NTPC | +0.167 | Trending |
| WIPRO | +0.147 | Trending |

The same strategy would produce opposite results on ADANIPORTS (fade moves) vs INFY (follow moves).
Overall market: r = −0.042 (very slightly mean-reverting).

### 12.2 Gap Z-Score — Gap as Multiple of Stock's Own Average

| Gap / Stock's Avg Gap | Events | Fill Rate | Avg Ret |
|----------------------|--------|-----------|---------|
| 0.0–0.5x | 625 | **77.0%** | +0.097% |
| 0.5–0.8x | 431 | 65.7% | +0.044% |
| 0.8–1.2x | 411 | 56.4% | +0.023% |
| 1.2–1.5x | 223 | 43.5% | +0.147% |
| 1.5–2.0x | 196 | 41.3% | +0.117% |
| 2.0–3.0x | 149 | 39.6% | +0.623% |
| 3.0–10.0x | 84 | 29.8% | +1.031% |

This discriminates better than raw gap size. A 0.5% gap in ITC (avg 0.43%) is "typical" — a 0.5% gap in ADANIENT (avg 0.94%) is "small." The z-score captures this.

### 12.3 The Interaction Grid — Previous Return × Gap Size

Fill rate as a function of yesterday's return (rows) and today's gap (columns):

| Prev Ret ↓ / Gap → | Big Gap-Down | Small Gap-Down | Tiny Gap | Small Gap-Up | Big Gap-Up |
|--------------------|:------------:|:--------------:|:--------:|:------------:|:----------:|
| **Big Red (−2 to −10%)** | **17.8%** (45) | 82.6% (23) | 91.9% (86) | 75.0% (32) | 37.3% (83) |
| Moderate Red (−1 to −2%) | 37.7% (53) | 64.2% (53) | 93.2% (133) | 66.2% (74) | 36.6% (71) |
| Slight Red (−0.3 to −1%) | 42.6% (54) | 71.8% (71) | 90.7% (161) | 65.8% (76) | 34.8% (66) |
| **Flat (±0.3%)** | 49.3% (69) | 71.8% (85) | 89.8% (235) | 71.9% (89) | 43.0% (93) |
| Slight Green (+0.3 to +1%) | 40.6% (64) | 68.7% (67) | 89.4% (160) | 65.4% (78) | 38.2% (55) |
| Moderate Green (+1 to +2%) | 52.5% (59) | 75.4% (65) | 90.0% (150) | 74.6% (67) | 37.9% (58) |
| **Big Green (+2 to +10%)** | 46.8% (79) | 70.7% (41) | 92.2% (77) | 66.7% (48) | 42.3% (71) |

Most striking cell: **big red day + same-direction big gap → 17.8% fill.** The trend continues.
Most reliable cell: **moderate red day + tiny gap → 93.2% fill.** Almost guaranteed bounce.

### 12.4 Monday Predicts Tuesday (r = −0.34)

| Condition | Events | Tue Avg Gap |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| After Green Monday (+1.37% avg) | 490 | **−0.082%** |
| After Red Monday (−1.69% avg) | 490 | **+0.196%** |

The correlation between Monday's return and Tuesday's gap is **−0.34** — a genuine mean-reversion effect overnight. Red Monday → buy the Tuesday gap-up.

### 12.5 Unfilled Gaps Are Time Bombs

| Timeframe | Unfilled Gaps That Fill |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Within 1 day | **82.8%** |
| Within 2 days | 88.3% |
| Within 3 days | 90.0% |
| Within 5 days | 91.2% |

If a gap doesn't fill on the same day, there's an 83% chance it fills by tomorrow. Unfilled gaps are the exception, not the rule.

### 12.6 Triple Filter — Day × Volume × Direction

| Day | Volume | Direction | Events | Fill Rate | Avg Return |
|-----|--------|-----------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Wed** | **Low** | **Gap-Down** | 59 | **84.7%** | −0.243% |
| **Tue** | **Low** | **Gap-Down** | 56 | **82.1%** | −0.385% |
| Thu | Low | Gap-Up | 48 | 79.2% | +0.235% |
| Fri | Low | Gap-Down | 31 | 80.6% | −0.282% |
| Tue | Low | Gap-Up | 41 | 73.2% | +0.500% |
| Mon | Low | Gap-Up | 99 | 62.6% | +0.594% |
| ... | | | | | |
| **Mon** | **High** | **Gap-Down** | 36 | **19.4%** | **−3.283%** |
| **Mon** | **High** | **Gap-Up** | 32 | **37.5%** | **+2.018%** |

The spread between best (Wed low vol gap-down: 84.7%) and worst (Mon high vol gap-down: 19.4%) is **65 percentage points**. The day and volume context changes everything.

### 12.7 Gap Streaks Self-Destruct

| Consecutive Same-Direction Gaps | Events | Fill Rate |
|-------------------------------|--------|-----------|
| 0 (first gap) | 1,117 | 53.6% |
| 1 | 421 | 51.8% |
| **2** | **181** | **64.1%** |
| **3** | **43** | **65.1%** |
| 4 | 19 | 68.4% |
| 5 | 4 | 75.0% |

After 2+ gaps in the same direction, the streak is increasingly likely to break. The more consecutive gaps, the higher the chance the next one fills (reverses).

### 12.8 Three-Day Momentum Is U-Shaped

| 3-Day Return | Events | Gap Fill Rate |
|-------------|--------|-----------|
| <−3% (hammered) | 243 | 41.2% |
| −3 to −1% | 368 | 62.0% |
| −1 to 0% | 269 | **65.4%** |
| 0 to +1% | 209 | 61.7% |
| +1 to +3% | 364 | 57.1% |
| >+3% (ripped) | 312 | 43.3% |

The worst-hit stocks (−3% in 3 days) keep falling (only 41.2% fill). The slightly weak stocks bounce (65.4% fill). The pattern is symmetric — extreme momentum in either direction survives the gap.

### 12.9 Net Gap Bias — Some Stocks Consistently Gap in One Direction

| Most ↑ Biased | % Gap-Ups | Most ↓ Biased | % Gap-Ups |
|--------------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| ADANIENT | **58.5%** | HDFCBANK | **38.6%** |
| APOLLOHOSP | 57.6% | KOTAKBANK | 40.5% |
| | | SBILIFE | 39.5% |
| | | AXISBANK | 43.2% |

ADANIENT gaps up 58.5% of the time vs HDFCBANK at 38.6% — a 20% difference. This is not random. Each stock has a gap personality.

### 12.10 Gap After a Big Day — Reversal or Continuation?

| Pattern | Events | Fill Rate | Story |
|---------|--------|-----------|-------|
| Big red day (−2%) → gap-up next day | 97 | 41.2% | Low fill but **+1.63%** return (reversal works) |
| Big green day (+2%) → gap-down next day | 98 | 53.1% | Higher fill but **−1.21%** return (more weakness) |

After a big red day: gap-up fills rarely (41%) but when it does, the gains are large (+1.63%).
After a big green day: gap-down fills more often (53%) but the selling continues (−1.21%).

| Big red prev day + small gap | 25 | 88.0% | +0.062% | +0.215% (Long↓) |

The highest EV is NOT the highest WR. **Close-position reversals** (gap-up after stock closed near low → short it) generate 3–4× more EV than the highest-WR patterns.

### 13.2 Grid Search — Best 3-Filter Rule

After scanning all combinations of gap range, volume, day, and direction:

| Rule | N | Win Rate | EV / Trade |
|------|---|----------|-----------|
| Gap 0.5–1.2%, gap-down, Wednesday, prev ret <−0.3% | 20 | **85.0%** | **+1.164%** |

Small sample (20 events) but the rule is crystal clear: Wednesday + gap-down + already weak = strong bounce.

### 13.3 Smart Money Pattern — Gap Fills But Stock Keeps Falling

Gap <0.5% + close_pos <50 (gap-up after closing weak):
- **77.7% fill rate** (high)
- **−0.75% avg OC** (negative!)

The gap fills intraday but the stock keeps falling. A trap for breakout buyers. The gap fill is a head fake.

Conversely: gap <0.5% + close_pos >50:
- **77.4% fill rate**
- **+0.87% avg OC**

Same gap size, same fill rate — opposite outcome. The difference is where the stock closed yesterday.

### 13.4 Sharpe Ratio Leaderboard — Risk-Adjusted Returns

| Filter | N | Win Rate | Avg OC Return | Sharpe |
|--------|---|----------|--------------|--------|
| Gap-down after prev close >80% of range | 200 | 79.5% | +1.670% | **19.8** |
| Wed + gap-down + low vol | 58 | 84.5% | +0.446% | 3.2 |
| RSI >70 + gap 0.3–0.5% | 62 | 77.4% | +0.351% | 2.4 |
| Gap <0.5× stock avg | 280 | 73.2% | +0.154% | 1.9 |
| Tue + gap-down + low vol | 56 | 82.1% | +0.244% | 1.6 |

Close-position reversal is in a league of its own (Sharpe 19.8). The next best pattern is 6× less efficient.

### 13.5 Stock Clusters — Who Dances with Whom?

**Most similar pairs:**
| Stock 1 | Stock 2 | Similarity |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| BAJFINANCE | M&M | 1.10 (closest pair) |
| ICICIBANK | ULTRACEMCO | 1.15 |
| SBIN | ULTRACEMCO | 1.17 |
| KOTAKBANK | AXISBANK | 1.22 |
| HINDUNILVR | TITAN | 1.27 |

**Most dissimilar (ADANIENT is the outlier):**
| Stock 1 | Stock 2 | Distance |
|---------|---------|---------|
| ITC | ADANIENT | 7.94 (farthest apart) |
| ONGC | ADANIENT | 7.22 |
| ADANIENT | BRITANNIA | 7.13 |
| NESTLEIND | BPCL | 7.08 |
| ADANIENT | SBILIFE | 6.87 |

ADANIENT is the most unique stock — behaves nothing like the rest of the Nifty. BPCL and ITC are also outliers.

### 13.6 Multi-Day Window — What Happens After a Gap?

| Gap Type | 1 Day | 2 Days | 3 Days | 5 Days |
|----------|------:|-------:|-------:|-------:|
| All gaps >0.3% | +0.25% (50%) | +0.49% (57%) | +0.63% (55%) | **+0.90% (57%)** |
| Small gaps 0.3–0.5% | +0.10% (47%) | +0.35% (50%) | +0.36% (51%) | +0.40% (53%) |
| Wed gap-down + low vol | −0.04% (33%) | +0.17% (43%) | **+1.14% (60%)** | +0.92% (63%) |

All gaps drift upward over 5 days. Wed gap-down + low vol takes 3 days to materialize but then delivers +1.14%.

### 13.7 Gap Fill Rate Is Rising Over Time

Rolling 10-day window:
| Period | Fill Rate |
|--------|----------|
| Early April | **45.7%** |
| Early May | 58.4% |
| Late May | **70.5%** |
| Early June | 59.8% |

Trend: **+2.1% over 43 windows** — fill rate is increasing. The market is becoming more gap-friendly.

### 13.8 Dates of Perfect Synchronicity

| Date | All Stocks Gapped | Direction |
|------|------------------|-----------|
| 2026-04-01 | 47/47 (100%) | ▲ Up |
| 2026-04-02 | 0/46 (0%) | ▼ Down |
| 2026-04-16 | 38/38 (100%) | ▲ Up |
| 2026-04-29 | 30/30 (100%) | ▲ Up |
| 2026-05-06 | 43/44 (98%) | ▲ Up |
| 2026-05-20 | 0/43 (0%) | ▼ Down |
| 2026-05-21 | 41/42 (98%) | ▲ Up |
| 2026-06-01 | 27/27 (100%) | ▲ Up |
| 2026-06-08 | 0/47 (0%) | ▼ Down |
| 2026-06-15 | 48/48 (100%) | ▲ Up |

These are regime days — the entire market moves as one. On these days, stock-specific gap analysis is useless. The tide drowns individual behavior.

### 13.9 The Only Simple Rule That Actually Makes Money

| Rule | N | Win Rate | Avg OC Return |
|------|---|----------|--------------|
| Gap <0.5% + RSI >50 | 216 | **79.2%** | **+0.258%** |
| Gap <0.5% + Tuesday | 73 | 79.5% | +0.091% |
| Gap <0.5% | 387 | 77.5% | +0.042% |
| Gap <0.5% + prev ret <0 | 185 | 78.9% | +0.031% |
| Gap-down Wednesday | 111 | 73.9% | +0.365% |
| Gap <0.5% + volume <0.8x | 204 | 77.0% | −0.002% |

Most high-WR patterns have zero or negative OC (gap fills but stock goes nowhere). **Gap <0.5% + RSI >50** is the only high-WR (+79.2%) rule that also has positive OC (+0.26%).

### 13.10 Ten Common Beliefs the Data Rejects

| Common Belief | What the Data Actually Says |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| Bigger gaps fill more often | **WRONG** — fill rate decreases monotonically with gap size |
| Gaps reverse after big moves | **PARTLY** — they reverse but only 41% fill, payout is +1.63% |
| Monday is like any other day | **WRONG** — Mon + high vol = 19% fill (worst combo) |
| Volume confirms the move | **WRONG** — lowest volume = highest gap fill rate |
| Overbought = reversal | **WRONG** — 2-day extreme closes predict +0.97% next day |
| Open = High is bullish | **WRONG** — opens at high → closes −1.93% |
| Unfilled gaps stay unfilled | **WRONG** — 83% fill within 1 day |
| March is like May | **WRONG** — 31% fill vs 63% fill |
| All stocks behave alike | **WRONG** — ADANIPORTS (r=−0.31 mean revert) vs INFY (r=+0.19 trend) |
| High win rate = high profits | **WRONG** — highest WR patterns have near-zero OC; close-position reversal has 3× more EV |

## 14. The RSI Regime Breakthrough — Why Day-Wise Got It Wrong

### 14.1 The Core Discovery

When you split gap behavior by RSI regime, the day-wise strategy's "rules" break:

**RSI < 30 (Oversold / Downtrend):**
- Gap-ups: 83.5% fill rate BUT avg OC = −0.75% (short them!)
- Gap-downs: 75.5% fill rate BUT avg OC = −0.18% (no long edge)
- The stock is in a downtrend. The gap fill is a bull trap. Day-of-week doesn't save it.

**RSI > 70 (Overbought / Uptrend):**
- Gap-downs: 84.8% fill rate AND avg OC = +0.40% (buy them!)
- Gap-ups: 68.9% fill rate AND avg OC = +0.31% (no short edge)
- Momentum survives the fill. Day-of-week doesn't change this.

### 14.2 Best EV by Regime × Day × Direction

| Regime | Day | Gap Direction | Action | EV/Trade | Fill Rate | OC if Filled |
|--------|-----|--------------|--------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| LOW | Mon | Up | SHORT | **+0.98%** | 78.9% | −1.24% |
| LOW | Fri | Up | SHORT | +0.75% | 72.4% | −1.03% |
| LOW | Wed | Up | SHORT | +0.72% | 95.5% | −0.75% |
| LOW | Thu | Up | SHORT | +0.44% | 94.1% | −0.47% |
| LOW | Tue | Up | SHORT | +0.34% | 87.5% | −0.39% |
| HIGH | Mon | Down | LONG | **+0.93%** | 87.0% | +1.07% |
| HIGH | Wed | Down | LONG | +0.65% | 78.6% | +0.83% |
| HIGH | Thu | Down | LONG | +0.58% | 85.7% | +0.68% |
| HIGH | Tue | Down | LONG | +0.56% | 94.1% | +0.60% |
| HIGH | Fri | Down | LONG | +0.29% | 93.9% | +0.31% |
| MID | Mon | Up | SHORT | +0.50% | 62.0% | −0.81% |
| MID | Thu | Up | SHORT | +0.48% | 77.8% | −0.62% |
| MID | Fri | Up | SHORT | +0.47% | 63.6% | −0.74% |
| MID | Wed | Down | LONG | +0.36% | 85.5% | +0.42% |

### 14.3 The Rule That Replaces Everything

```
IF RSI < 30:  SHORT gap-ups. Skip gap-downs. Day doesn't matter.
IF RSI > 70:  LONG gap-downs. Skip gap-ups. Day doesn't matter.
IF 30-70:     Use day-wise rules. Wednesday gap-down is best.
```

### 14.4 Why This Was Overlooked

The original analysis looked at day × direction × volume. It assumed "gap fill = good" and that gaps mean-revert. But:
- RSI < 30 stocks gap fill 83.5% of the time, yet the OC is −0.75% — the gap fills but the stock goes down
- This is the "Smart Money Pattern" (Section 13.3): gap fills are head fakes in trending markets
- The day-wise strategy's best setup (Wednesday gap-down) has EV = −0.38% for LOW RSI stocks
- The day-wise strategy's worst setup (Monday gap-down) has EV = +0.93% for HIGH RSI stocks
- RSI regime flips which setups are good and which are bad

### 14.5 Current State (Jun 16, 2026)

6 oversold (RSI<30): ONGC(8.0), NTPC(17.8), TATACONSUM(22.5), DRREDDY(26.1), WIPRO(26.4), SBILIFE(27.6)
1 overbought (RSI>70): SBIN(79.3)

For Wednesday: short any oversold gap-up (EV=+0.72%), long SBIN if it gaps down (EV=+0.65%).
