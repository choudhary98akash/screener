## 1. The Day-of-Week Effect (Strongest Signal in the Data)

| Day | Avg Return | % Positive | Personality |
|-----|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Monday | **−0.283%** | 45.4% | Weak, bearish |
| Tuesday | **+0.180%** | 53.8% | Mildly bullish |
| **Wednesday** | **+0.798%** | **65.0%** | **Strongly bullish** |
| **Thursday** | **−0.280%** | **37.6%** | **Strongly bearish** |
| Friday | −0.046% | 45.8% | Neutral, weak |

Wednesday is the outlier: stocks go up 65% of the time, averaging +0.80%.
Thursday is the mirror: stocks go down 62.4% of the time.
The swing between Wednesday and Thursday is **1.08%** — the largest predictable pattern in the dataset.

## 2. Gap Size vs Fill Rate (Monotonic Relationship)

| Gap Range | Events | Filled | Fill Rate |
|-----------|--------|--------|-----------|
| 0.0–0.3% | 1,073 | 975 | 90.9% |
| 0.3–0.5% | 436 | 324 | 74.3% |
| 0.5–0.8% | 482 | 312 | 64.7% |
| 0.8–1.2% | 448 | 220 | 49.1% |
| 1.2–2.0% | 365 | 128 | 35.1% |
| 2.0–5.0% | 172 | 44 | 25.6% |
| >5.0% | 12 | 1 | 8.3% |

The relationship is clean and monotonic: **smaller gaps fill more often, larger gaps fill less often.** There is no threshold where this reverses — every step up in gap size reduces fill probability.

---

## 3. Gap Fill Rate by Day of Week

| Day | Gaps | Filled | Fill Rate |
|-----|------|--------|-----------|
| Monday | 637 | 363 | 57.0% |
| **Tuesday** | **539** | **418** | **77.6%** |
| Wednesday | 637 | 390 | 61.2% |
| Thursday | 588 | 412 | 70.1% |
| Friday | 587 | 421 | 71.7% |

Tuesday is the best day for gap fills (77.6%). Monday is the worst (57.0%).

---

## 4. Gap Fill Rate vs Previous Day's Range

| Prev Day Range | Gaps | Filled | Fill Rate |
|---------------|------|--------|-----------|
| 0.0–1.0% | 184 | 147 | 79.9% |
| 1.0–1.5% | 398 | 278 | 69.8% |
| 1.5–2.0% | 688 | 488 | 70.9% |
| 2.0–3.0% | 1,044 | 670 | 64.2% |
| >3.0% | 674 | 421 | 62.5% |

When the previous day was calm (range <1%), gaps fill 79.9% of the time. When the previous day was volatile (range >3%), gaps fill only 62.5%.

---

## 5. Gap Direction + Previous Day Direction

| Pattern | Gaps | Filled | Fill Rate |
|---------|------|--------|-----------|
| Gap continues prev day trend | 1,173 | 745 | 63.5% |
| Gap reverses prev day trend | 999 | 521 | 52.2% |

Gaps that continue the trend fill more often (63.5%) than gaps that reverse the trend (52.2%). This contradicts the assumption that "reversal gaps fill more."

---

## 6. Gap-Up vs Gap-Down

| | Events | Avg OC Return | Avg Fill % | Filled |
|--|--------|--------------|-----------|--------|
| Gap-Up | 1,463 | +0.035% | 79.4% | 63.0% |
| Gap-Down | 1,260 | −0.052% | 80.4% | 64.9% |

Gap-down days fill slightly more often (64.9% vs 63.0%). Both directions see ~80% average fill percentage (including partial fills).

---

## 7. What Correlates with Next Day's Return?

| Factor | Correlation (r) |
|--------|----------------|
| Today's gap size | **−0.103** |
| Today's return | −0.053 |
| Today's volume vs average | −0.039 |
| Today's range | +0.039 |

Gap size has the strongest (negative) correlation with next day's return: larger gaps today predict lower returns tomorrow.

## 11. Overlooked Patterns (Deeper Exploration)

### 11.1 Volume Surge Effect — Strongest Filter We Missed

| Volume Ratio (vs 10d avg) | Events | Filled | Fill Rate |
|--------------------------|--------|--------|-----------|
| 0.0–0.5x | 158 | 109 | 69.0% |
| 0.5–0.8x | 544 | 309 | 56.8% |
| 0.8–1.0x | 373 | 195 | 52.3% |
| 1.0–1.2x | 276 | 142 | 51.4% |
| 1.2–1.5x | 256 | 123 | 48.0% |
| 1.5–2.0x | 158 | 75 | 47.5% |
| 2.0–3.0x | 79 | 37 | 46.8% |
| 3.0x+ | 53 | 25 | 47.2% |

Fill rate drops **monotonically** from 69% (quiet) to 47% (high volume).
Low vol + gap-down: **63.0%** fill. High vol + gap-down: only **43.8%**.

### 11.2 Close Position in Range → Next Day

| Close Position | Events | Avg Next Return | Positive % |
|---------------|--------|----------------|-----------|
| Bottom 20% | 654 | +0.074% | 50.2% |
| 20–40% | 612 | −0.054% | 48.3% |
| 40–60% | 599 | −0.042% | 45.6% |
| 60–80% | 531 | −0.032% | 47.7% |
| **Top 20%** | **543** | **+0.360%** | **52.7%** |

Stocks closing at the top of their range outperform next day. Strength begets strength — no mean reversion edge.

### 11.3 2-Day "Extreme Persistence" (Not Reversal)

| 2-Day Close Position | Events | Avg Next Return | Positive % |
|---------------------|--------|----------------|-----------|
| > +30 (mild strength) | 571 | +0.420% | 55.0% |
| > +50 (strength) | 289 | +0.573% | 58.8% |
| **> +70 (extreme)** | **127** | **+0.971%** | **62.2%** |
| < −30 (mild weak) | 740 | +0.162% | 52.3% |
| < −50 (weak) | 407 | +0.278% | 56.0% |
| < −70 (extreme) | 116 | +0.392% | 57.8% |

Stocks that have been strong for 2 consecutive days continue being strong. The more extreme the 2-day strength, the stronger the next day. This directly contradicts the "overbought = reversal" assumption.

### 11.4 EMA9 Proximity — Gap Fill Rate

| Distance from EMA9 | Events | Fill Rate |
|-------------------|--------|-----------|
| 0–1% | 651 | **64.5%** |
| 1–2% | 506 | 55.5% |
| 2–5% | 649 | 43.6% |

Gaps near the EMA9 fill far more reliably (64.5%) than gaps far from it (43.6%).

### 11.5 RSI Zones — Gap Fill vs Return Divergence

| RSI Zone | Events | Fill Rate | Avg Return |
|---------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| <30 (oversold) | 123 | **69.9%** | **−0.614%** |
| 30–40 | 207 | 55.6% | −0.398% |
| 40–50 | 300 | 57.7% | −0.002% |
| 50–60 | 312 | 53.5% | +0.569% |
| 60–70 | 262 | 53.4% | +0.485% |
| >70 (overbought) | 214 | **64.0%** | **+0.870%** |

RSI < 30: gap fills 69.9% of the time but stock still closes **−0.61%** (gap fills but trend is down).
RSI > 70: gap fills 64% but stock closes **+0.87%** (momentum survives the fill).

### 11.6 Day × Gap Direction — Best Combos

| Day | Direction | Events | Fill Rate | Avg OC Return |
|-----|-----------|--------|-----------|--------------|
| **Tue** | Gap-down | 152 | **69.7%** | **+0.234%** |
| **Wed** | Gap-down | 114 | **74.6%** | **+0.383%** |
| Thu | Gap-up | 150 | 71.3% | −0.144% |
| Mon | Gap-down | 273 | 39.9% | −0.288% |
| Wed | Gap-up | 305 | 35.1% | +0.265% |

Wednesday gap-downs: **74.6%** fill rate with **+0.38%** avg return — the single best cell in the grid.
Monday gap-ups: only 35.1% fill (worst).
Tuesday gap-downs: 69.7% fill, +0.23% return.

### 11.7 Stock-By-Stock Best Conditions

| Condition | Stocks Where It's #1 | Avg WR |
|-----------|---------------------|--------|
| **Tuesday** | **16 stocks** | **86.2%** |
| gap 0.3–0.5% | 15 stocks | 88.7% |
| gap 0.5–0.8% | 5 stocks | 85.3% |
| Thursday | 4 stocks | 91.7% |
| Low volume | 3 stocks | 81.0% |
| Wednesday | 2 stocks | 88.5% |
| Previous day down | 2 stocks | 88.3% |

Tuesday is the highest-signal day: 16/49 stocks have their best WR on Tuesday (avg 86.2%).
Small gaps (0.3–0.5%) are the best blanket condition: 15 stocks, avg 88.7% WR.

### 11.8 Weekend Effect

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Avg weekend gap (Fri close → Mon open) | **−0.741%** |
| Positive weekends | 228/587 (38.8%) |
| Weekends with >0.3% gap | 553/587 (94.2%) |

Nearly all weekends produce a gap, and 61% of those gaps are negative. Monday opens weak.

### 11.9 Open = Daily High/Low (Extreme Intraday Reversals)

| Pattern | Events | Avg OC Return |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| Open = Day's High | 116 | **−1.928%** |
| Open = Day's Low | 108 | **+1.985%** |

When a stock opens at its high (never trades higher), it closes nearly 2% lower on average.
When it opens at its low (never trades lower), it closes nearly 2% higher.
Rare event (~4% of days) but extremely reliable when it happens.

### 11.10 March vs May — The Month Effect

| Month | Events | Fill Rate | Avg Return |
|-------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| March | 325 | 31.1% | −0.777% |
| April | 653 | 52.2% | +0.543% |
| **May** | **546** | **62.8%** | **+0.088%** |
| **June** | **373** | **61.7%** | **+0.127%** |

March was an outlier — only 31.1% gap fill and −0.78% avg return. May/June are much more favorable with 62% fill rates. A strategy's March performance would look terrible, and May would look great — same strategy, different calendar.
