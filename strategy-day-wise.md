## Overview: The Personality of Each Day

| Day | Avg Return | Gap Fill Rate | Best Vol | Worst Vol | Personality |
|-----|-----------|--------------|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Mon** | −0.28% | 57.0% | Low (62%) | **High (19%)** | Weak, toxic with volume |
| **Tue** | +0.18% | **77.6%** | Low (73–82%) | High (35–42%) | The golden day |
| **Wed** | **+0.80%** | 61.2% | Low **(85%)** | High (40–54%) | Bullish, fade gap-ups |
| **Thu** | **−0.28%** | 70.1% | Low (62–79%) | High (57–64%) | Bearish, fade gap-downs |
| **Fri** | −0.05% | 71.7% | Low (55–81%) | High (60–78%) | Neutral, positional |

---

## Monday — The Toxic Day

### Personality
- Weakest day of the week: −0.28% avg return, 45.4% positive
- Weekend gap: Fri close → Mon open averages **−0.74%** (61% negative)
- After a red Friday: expect even weaker Monday open
- **High volume + Monday is toxic**: gap-down fills only 19.4%, gap-up fills 37.5%
- Low volume + Monday is still weak but tradable

### What to Trade

| Setup | When | Fill Rate | Avg Return | Verdict |
|-------|------|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Gap-down + low vol** | Mon + vol<0.8x + gap<−0.3% | 45.6% | −0.88% | ❌ **SKIP** — not worth the risk |
| **Gap-up + low vol** | Mon + vol<0.8x + gap>+0.3% | 62.6% | +0.59% | ⚠️ When volume is low, short gap-ups (62.6% fill OC +0.59%) |
| **Gap-down + high vol** | Mon + vol>1.5x + gap<−0.3% | **19.4%** | −3.28% | 🚫 **NEVER** — 19% fill rate, worst in entire dataset |
| **Gap-up + high vol** | Mon + vol>1.5x + gap>+0.3% | **37.5%** | +2.02% | 🚫 **NEVER** — high vol gaps on Monday are traps |
| Gap <0.5% | Any vol, any direction | ~62% | ~0.0% | ⚠️ Marginal — only if vol<0.8x |
| **Prev day (Fri) was strong + gap-dn** | Fri ret >+2% → Mon gap-dn | 53.1% | −1.21% | ❌ Gap continues weakness |

### Rules
```
MONDAY:
  ✅ TRADE: Low-vol gap-up ONLY (short the gap-up)
  ❌ SKIP:  Gap-down entirely (even low vol is −0.88% avg)
  🚫 NEVER: High volume in ANY direction (19-37% fill)
  ⚠️ CAUTION: After a big Friday move, expect continuation not reversal

  REASONING:
    Monday opens weak (weekend gap −0.74%).
    Gap-downs on Monday = selling pressure continues.
    Only gap-ups offer a fading opportunity, and only with low volume.
```

---

## Tuesday — The Golden Day

### Personality
- **Best day** for gap fills: 77.6% overall
- 16 out of 49 stocks have their highest win rate on Tuesday
- Tuesday's return is negatively correlated with Monday (r = −0.34)
- After a red Monday, Tuesday gaps UP (+0.20%)
- After a green Monday, Tuesday gaps DOWN (−0.08%)
- Low volume + Tuesday is extraordinary

### What to Trade

| Setup | When | Fill Rate | Avg Return | Verdict |
|-------|------|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Gap-down + low vol** | Tue + vol<0.8x + gap<−0.3% | **82.1%** | −0.39% (long: +0.39%) | ✅ **BEST** — 82% fill, positive EV |
| **Gap-up + low vol** | Tue + vol<0.8x + gap>+0.3% | **73.2%** | +0.50% (short: +0.50%) | ✅ **TRADE** — 73% fill, positive EV |
| Gap-down + high vol | Tue + vol>1.5x + gap<−0.3% | 42.1% | −1.39% | ❌ SKIP |
| Gap-up + high vol | Tue + vol>1.5x + gap>+0.3% | 35.0% | +2.56% | ❌ SKIP |
| Gap <0.5% + Tuesday | Any vol | **79.5%** | +0.09% | ✅ TRADE |
| Gap <0.5% + low vol | Tue + 0.3–0.5% + vol<0.8x | **~80%** | +0.15% | ✅ **BEST** |
| **After red Monday** | Mon ret <0 → Tue gap-dn | 69.7% | +0.23% | ✅ TRADE gap-down (mean reversion) |

### Rules
```
TUESDAY:
  ✅ TRADE ALL: low-vol gaps in BOTH directions
  ✅ BEST: gap-down + low vol (82.1% fill, +0.39% EV long)
  ✅ BEST: gap <0.5% + any direction (79.5% fill)
  ❌ SKIP:  high vol gaps (>1.5x volume)
  🎯 EDGE: After red Monday, Tuesday gaps up — buy the gap-down

  REASONING:
    Tuesday has the highest unconditional gap fill rate.
    Low volume confirms the gap is noise — smart money fades it.
    Monday's close predicts Tuesday's open (r=−0.34).
```

---

## Wednesday — The Bullish Reversal Day

### Personality
- **Strongest bullish day**: +0.80% avg return, 65% positive
- Gap-down fills at **74.6%** — highest of any day-direction combo
- **Gap-up is a disaster**: only 35.1% fill rate
- Wednesday + gap-down + low vol = **84.7% fill** (best single cell in the dataset)
- Wednesday gap-ups that fill: stock still closes +0.27% on average (bullish bias)

### What to Trade

| Setup | When | Fill Rate | Avg Return | Verdict |
|-------|------|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Gap-down + low vol** | Wed + vol<0.8x + gap<−0.3% | **84.7%** | +0.45% | ✅ **#1 BEST SETUP IN DATA** |
| **Gap-down** | Wed + gap<−0.3% (any vol) | **74.6%** | +0.38% | ✅ **EXCELLENT** — best day-dir combo |
| Gap-down + high vol | Wed + vol>1.5x + gap<−0.3% | 54.5% | −1.22% | ❌ Skip if high vol |
| **Gap-up + low vol** | Wed + vol<0.8x + gap>+0.3% | **31.3%** | +1.31% | 🚫 **40% fill even with low vol — SKIP** |
| Gap-up | Wed + gap>+0.3% (any) | **35.1%** | +0.27% | 🚫 **NEVER BUY WED GAP-UPS** |
| Gap-up + high vol | Wed + vol>1.5x + gap>+0.3% | 40.0% | +3.02% | 🚫 NEVER |
| Prev day was strong bear | Tue strong bear + Wed gap-dn | N/A | Strong session | ✅ TRADE gap-down aggressively |

### Rules
```
WEDNESDAY:
  ✅ TRADE ALL: gap-downs (74.6% fill overall)
  ✅ BEST IN DATA: gap-down + low vol (84.7% fill, +0.45% avg)
  🚫 NEVER:  gap-ups (35.1% fill — worst day-dir combo)
  ❌ SKIP:  only if volume is >1.5x AND gap-down (54.5% fill, still okay)
  🎯 EDGE: Wednesday is bullish (+0.80%). Gap-downs are buying opportunities.

  REASONING:
    Wednesday is the most bullish day of the week.
    Gap-downs on a bullish day = fake selloff that reverses.
    Gap-ups on a bullish day = euphoria that fades (only 35% fill).
    The market WANTS to go up on Wednesday — don't fight it.
```

---

## Thursday — The Bearish Reversal Day

### Personality
- **Most bearish day**: −0.28% avg return, only 37.6% positive
- Gap-up fills at **71.3%** — high (market tends to reverse lower)
- Wednesday predicts Thursday: strong Wed → Thu gap-down (−0.11%)
- Weak Wed → Thu gap-down even harder (−0.45%)
- Thursday + gap-up + low vol = 79.2% fill, +0.44% EV (short)
- Thursday bearish regardless of Wednesday's close position

### What to Trade

| Setup | When | Fill Rate | Avg Return | Verdict |
|-------|------|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Gap-up + low vol** | Thu + vol<0.8x + gap>+0.3% | **79.2%** | −0.44% (short: +0.44%) | ✅ **TRADE** — short gap-ups |
| **Gap-up** | Thu + gap>+0.3% (any vol) | **71.3%** | −0.14% (short: +0.14%) | ✅ TRADE |
| Gap-up + high vol | Thu + vol>1.5x + gap>+0.3% | 64.0% | +1.93% | ⚠️ Mixed — 64% fill but big payout if wrong |
| Gap-down + low vol | Thu + vol<0.8x + gap<−0.3% | 61.8% | −0.53% | ⚠️ Marginal |
| Gap-down | Thu + gap<−0.3% (any) | 51.5% | +0.04% | ❌ SKIP — 50/50 |
| Gap-down + high vol | Thu + vol>1.5x + gap<−0.3% | 57.1% | −0.35% | ❌ SKIP |
| **After strong Wed** | Wed OC >+1% → Thu gap-dn | 51.5% | −0.20% | ❌ Weak signal |

### Rules
```
THURSDAY:
  ✅ TRADE: gap-ups (71.3% fill — short the gap-up)
  ✅ BEST: gap-up + low vol (79.2% fill, +0.44% EV shorting)
  ❌ SKIP:  gap-downs (51.5% fill — no edge)
  🚫 NEVER: buy gap-downs on Thursday
  🎯 EDGE: Thursday is bearish. Gap-ups are fake rallies that reverse.

  REASONING:
    Thursday is the most bearish day (−0.28%, 37.6% positive).
    Gap-ups on a bearish day = dead cat bounce that fills.
    The market WANTS to go down on Thursday.
    Wednesday's strength carries into Thursday gap but then reverses.
```

---

## Friday — The Positional Day

### Personality
- Neutral: −0.05% avg return, 45.8% positive
- Gap fill rate: 71.7% (second highest)
- Gap-down + low vol = 80.6% fill
- **Gap-up + high vol = 78.1% fill** — unusual, high vol gap-ups work on Friday
- Weekend effect: positions are squared before Monday
- Friday's close determines Monday's open (weekend gap avg −0.74%)

### What to Trade

| Setup | When | Fill Rate | Avg Return | Verdict |
|-------|------|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Gap-down + low vol** | Fri + vol<0.8x + gap<−0.3% | **80.6%** | −0.28% (long: +0.28%) | ✅ **TRADE** |
| **Gap-up + high vol** | Fri + vol>1.5x + gap>+0.3% | **78.1%** | −0.13% (short: +0.13%) | ✅ **UNUSUAL** — high vol gap-ups work on Fri |
| Gap-down | Fri + gap<−0.3% (any) | 54.3% | −0.57% | ⚠️ Mixed |
| Gap-up + low vol | Fri + vol<0.8x + gap>+0.3% | 55.0% | +0.62% | ⚠️ Marginal |
| Gap-down + high vol | Fri + vol>1.5x + gap<−0.3% | 60.7% | −2.25% | ❌ SKIP (big losses) |

### Rules
```
FRIDAY:
  ✅ TRADE: gap-down + low vol (80.6% fill)
  ✅ TRADE: gap-up + high vol (78.1% fill — exception to the rule)
  ❌ SKIP:  gap-down + high vol (−2.25% avg loss)
  🎯 Close positions before weekend (no overnight gap risk)

  REASONING:
    Friday is positional — traders square books before weekend.
    Gap-downs with low vol = end-of-week bargain hunting.
    Gap-ups with high vol = short covering before weekend.
    Gap-downs with high vol = panic selling into close.
```

## The Complete Daily Checklist

### Monday Checklist
```
□ Scan gaps 0.3-0.8% only
□ Check volume ratio (<0.8x is good, >1.5x is toxic)
□ Trade gap-ups ONLY (short)
□ Skip gap-downs entirely
□ If volume >1.5x in ANY direction: skip
□ Check if Friday was a big move day (ret >2%)
  → If yes, expect continuation, not reversal
```

### Tuesday Checklist
```
□ Scan gaps 0.3-0.8%
□ Check volume ratio (<0.8x is golden)
□ Trade BOTH directions if volume is low
□ After red Monday: prioritize gap-down (long)

□ Skip if volume >1.5x
```

### Wednesday Checklist
```
□ Scan gaps 0.3-0.8%
□ Trade ALL gap-downs (long)
□ Volume <0.8x → 84.7% fill (maximum confidence)
□ Volume 0.8-1.5x → 74.6% fill (still excellent)

□ IGNORE all gap-ups completely (35% fill)
□ Best day of the week for this strategy
```

```
□ Scan gaps 0.3-0.8%
□ Trade gap-down + low vol (80.6% fill)
□ Trade gap-up + high vol (78.1% fill — exception)

## Key Insights from the Data

1. **Tuesday is special.** 77.6% overall fill rate, best condition for 16/49 stocks. If you could only trade one day, it would be Tuesday.

2. **Wednesday gap-down is the single best setup.** 84.7% fill on low volume, 74.6% even with normal volume. Wednesday is bullish (+0.80%), so gap-downs are fake selloffs.

3. **Monday high volume is toxic.** 19.4% fill on gap-down + high vol. The worst cell in the entire dataset. Avoid Monday at all costs if volume is elevated.

4. **Thursday gap-ups are reliable shorts.** 71.3% fill rate overall. Thursday is bearish (−0.28%), so gap-ups are fake rallies.

5. **Volume trumps everything.** Low volume (<0.8x) improves fill rate by 15-30 percentage points on any day. High volume (>1.5x) destroys the edge.

6. **The day-of-week effect dominates.** The spread between best setup (Wed gap-down + low vol: 84.7%) and worst setup (Mon gap-down + high vol: 19.4%) is **65 percentage points** — far larger than any single filter like gap size alone.
